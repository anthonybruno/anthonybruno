# Hey, Iâ€™m Anthony ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an Engineering Manager with 15+ years in frontend. My work has ranged from polished web platforms to SaaS products serving thousands and benefit systems reaching millions of employees. Iâ€™ve led projects for Google and Meta, and helped scale products all the way through acquisition.

These days, Iâ€™m focused on developer experience and AI-powered workflows that cut friction, speed delivery, and give teams space to solve bigger problems.
