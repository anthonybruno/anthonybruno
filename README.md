# Hey, Iâ€™m Anthony

Engineering Manager and longtime Frontend Engineer based in Denver, CO. I build web platforms, lead product teams, and care deeply about accessibility, developer experience, and clear, maintainable systems.

My recent work includes:
- ðŸ“¦ Developer tooling to unify standards across teams: linting, commits, logging, and more: [`@brunotony/dev-config`](https://github.com/abruno/dev-config)
- âœ¨ An AI-powered commit assistant that writes clear, conventional messages based on diffs: [`gpt-auto-commit`](https://github.com/anthonybruno/gpt-auto-commit)

I thrive in curious, mission-driven teams where engineering, empathy, and clarity come together.
