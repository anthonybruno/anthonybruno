# 👋 Hi, I’m Anthony Bruno

I'm an Engineering Manager and veteran Frontend Engineer based in Denver, CO. I build resilient, accessible, and human-centered web platforms — and lead teams that do the same.

My work blends deep frontend experience with a strong focus on developer experience, technical strategy, and modern AI tooling. I care about shipping high-quality products, supporting thoughtful teams, and creating systems that scale — in impact, not just code.

## ⚡ Fun Fact

Before I wrote my first line of React, I studied interactive media design at a tiny art school and built Flash websites for music festivals. These days, I design systems and lead teams, but I still believe the best work starts with empathy, iteration, and a solid CSS strategy.
