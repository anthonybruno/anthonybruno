# Hey, Iâ€™m Anthony ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an Engineering Manager with 15+ years in frontend, where Iâ€™ve gone from building polished web platforms to rebuilding SaaS products used by thousands and platforms that reach millions of employees. Along the way Iâ€™ve led projects for companies like Google and Meta and helped scale products to acquisition.

These days, Iâ€™m focused on developer experience and AI-powered workflows that cut friction, speed delivery, and free teams to solve bigger problems.
