# Hey, Iâ€™m Anthony

Engineering Manager and longtime Frontend Engineer based in Denver, CO.  

I build web platforms, lead product teams, and care deeply about accessibility, developer experience, and clear, maintainable systems.

### Featured projects
- ðŸ“¦ **[dev-config](https://github.com/anthonybruno/dev-config)** â€” Shared developer tooling to unify standards across teams (ESLint, Prettier, Commitlint, TypeScript configs, semantic-release)  
- âœ¨ **[gpt-auto-commit](https://github.com/anthonybruno/gpt-auto-commit)** â€” AI-powered commit assistant that generates clear, conventional messages from git diffs  

I thrive in curious, mission-driven teams where engineering, empathy, and clarity come together.
